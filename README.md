✅ **How this works on GitHub:**  
- Every block with triple backticks (\`\`\`) becomes a **copyable box**.  
- `bash` or `env` after the first backticks gives **syntax highlighting**.  
- Users can click **“Copy”** in the GitHub interface directly.  

---

If you want, I can also **make the README visually even nicer** with:  

- Screenshot thumbnails inline  
- Buttons/links for backend/frontend  
- Quick **demo flow diagram**  

Do you want me to do that next?
